# basic-password-generator

## Hi there!
I'm Ahmet, and I'm currently on a journey to learn Python.\n
I decided that uploading my files to GitHub would be great, so i did.\n

## The project
The project itself is very simple.\n
It includes a single Python file, which has the job to:\n
· take the length of the password that the user will receive\n 
· create a "strong" password that may include symbols, (such as @, # etc.) numbers and letters (uppercase and lowercase)\n
· show the password to the user

## Tools
I used https://www.w3schools.com and ChatGPT while making this project.\n

・ W3Schools for syntax rules that I forgot during the coding session\n
・ ChatGPT to discuss and fix the errors while I learn and develop myself more

## Note
This project is not made for daily usage.\n
I highly reccomend using a password manager.
