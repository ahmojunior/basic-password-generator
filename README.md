# basic-password-generator

## Hi there! 👋
I'm Ahmet, and I'm currently on a journey to learn Python.  
I decided that uploading my files to GitHub would be great, so i did.  

## The project 🚀
The project itself is very simple.
It includes a single Python file, which has the job to:  
    
· take the length of the password that the user will receive  
· create a "strong" password that may include symbols, (such as @, # etc.) numbers and letters (uppercase and lowercase)  
· show the password to the user  

## Tools 🛠️
I used https://www.w3schools.com and ChatGPT while making this project.  
    
・ W3Schools for syntax rules that I forgot during the coding session  
・ ChatGPT to discuss and fix the errors while I learn and develop myself more  

## Note 📝
This project is not made for daily usage.  
I highly reccomend using a password manager.
